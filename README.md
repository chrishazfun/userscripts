# userscripts
Various userscripts, made to varying degrees of quality (Issues welcomed)

## What are userscripts?
Userscripts are extensions written to be installed in userscript managers, the benefits of userscripts as opposed to standard extensions mainly lie in fixes can be pushed way faster. Here are some I've made, use any userscript manager (my preferred one is [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

## Ones I've made:
### [give-up-twitter.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishazfun/userscripts/main/give-up-twitter.user.js)
Redirects any twitter.com/x.com (subdomains too) url to Rick Astleys smash hit. (enable video autoplay in your browsers settings)
### [ddgl-google-bing.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishazfun/userscripts/main/ddgl-google-bing.user.js)
Adds two link shortcuts to open any query made on DuckDuckGo Lite on either Google or Bing, the ebil search engines.
### [unbuzzwordify.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishazfun/userscripts/main/unbuzzwordify.user.js)
Replaces certain buzzwords with other, more entertaining words.
### [unbuzzwordify-woke.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishazfun/userscripts/main/unbuzzwordify-woke.user.js)
Same as regular Unbuzzwordify but just for the word woke, like a taster for the full thing.
